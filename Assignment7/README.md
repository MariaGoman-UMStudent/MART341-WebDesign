Honestly, there's not much to look at with my website, but one thing I'm proud of is the color choices so far. I would like to improve on the website as we go through this course, if possible. 

As of now, I'm struggling to improve the aesthetics of the website because of my lack of knowledge. On the CONTACT US page I tried to remove the border around the email form, but I don't know how. I also tried to put the ahref links on the top right corner of the page without changing the position of the first header, but it kept moving the header out of the center, so I put the links towards the bottom of the page. It's the best I could do for now. Also, on the index page, I can't figure out how to put the list in the center... The last time I tried, the dots still remained on the left side of the page. I definitely would like some guidance and assistance on these issues.
