-I definitely had to make a few adjustments to my page. I had to scale the image down and center it in the middle so it looked more balanced and coherent. I also changed the background color to match the colors of the main image. The website still looks unfinished and I could have done better with the design, it's a start.

-Honestly, I had something way more grand in mind for my initial idea, but my lack of skills prevented me from going bigger with the design.

-I've had previous experience with float and margins in the past to scale and center images and they have always been a struggle for me.

-The only issue I encountered with the CSS styling was trying to make the list tag centered, but it didn't work. I wonder if I had to make it it's own class and use additional css coding in another page.

-So far, I'm doing okay. I might need more help and practice with centering images and paragraphs. There seems to be many ways to do it when I look it up online and when you attempt it yourself, it doesn't work. So that can be frustrating sometimes.
