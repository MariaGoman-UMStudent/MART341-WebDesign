Required techniques:
-I used a previous page to continue working on, and it came with a style.css file
-I added a hover effect over the banner text. The "Jisei Poems" text turns pink when you hover the mouse over it to match the image of the cherry blossoms below and to bring more cohesion to the design.
-I used an external font from a font library (Google Fonts) on the author of the example poem. I used a more oriental font to match the Japanese aesthetic.
-(P.S) I struggled with the self-hosted fonts and couldn't find a link that would work

3 additional techniques:
-I added an underline on the example poem
-I adjusted the line spacing in the explanitory paragraph to make it user friendly and easier to read
-I added another pink hover affect over the author name to match the overall design and color scheme
