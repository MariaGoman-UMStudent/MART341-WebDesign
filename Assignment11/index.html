            Empty-handed I entered the world. <br> 
            Barefoot I leave it <br>
            My coming, my going- <br>
            Two simple happenings <br>
            That got entangled. <br>

        Japanese death poems, known as jisei (辞世), are traditional poems written by individuals nearing death, 
        often reflecting their thoughts on life, death, and the transient nature of existence. These poems, typically 
        composed in the form of a haiku or choka, capture a moment of profound reflection and acceptance. Many were written 
        by samurai, monks, or poets as they faced their final moments, offering a serene and philosophical approach to mortality. 
        The jisei is considered a way to find peace and express one's spiritual perspective at the end of life, emphasizing the 
        impermanence of the human experience.
