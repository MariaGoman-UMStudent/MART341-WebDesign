<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<br>

<h2>Coffee Shop Website</h2>
<p>For this website, I would like a calm and vintage vibe because that would go well with the aesthetic of my dream coffee shop.
    I imagine a natural color scheme with blue, green, brown hues to give it an organic feel. </p>
<h2>Graphic Design Portfolio</h2>
<p>For this website I would want it to look professional with a clean design, good alignment, and easy accessibility 
    for users and future employers. </p>
<h2>Wedding Website</h2>
<p>Similar to the portfolio website, I want it to look clean and profressional, with easy navigation for the wedding guests to follow. 
    I want the color scheme and background to match the aesthetic of the wedding: Rustic with some classic vibes.
