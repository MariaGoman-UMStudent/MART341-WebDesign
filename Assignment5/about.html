<h1>Why I chose these website ideas</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Coffee shop wesbite</h2>
<p>One of my biggest dreams is to open up a coffee shop. It would be cool to make a website for it to make the dream seem more real.</p>

<h2>Graphic Design Portfolio</h2>
<p>I'm interested in becoming a freelance graphic designer one day. I know that people in the media/arts 
    field need profressional portfolios to show for potential future employers and clients</p>

<h2>Wedding Website</h2>
<p>I'm getting married soon and I think it would be a great idea to have a website with all the resources for the guests. It would include
    things like a link to the wedding registry, the address to the venue, and a program of the wedding day so guests know what to expect.</p>
