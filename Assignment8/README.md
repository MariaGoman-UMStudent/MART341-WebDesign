I used div elements to organize the menu with pictures. I find that they are the easiest to work with... One day I would like to make the menu with the prices on the side and I know you'd have to make a table for that, but it seems very hard to do, so I might need some help with that.

I really like how this one coffee shop made their menu page and I would like to make mine look similar to it.
