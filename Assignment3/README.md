# "How's the course going so far?":

## February 1, 2025

So far, I'm really liking this course. I might have been a little confused with the tutorials in the beginning because I had a late start but I think I'm coming around to it.

I have prior experience to GitHub so right now it's easy for me to understand what's going on.
